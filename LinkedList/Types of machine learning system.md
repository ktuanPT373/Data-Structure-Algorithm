# Supervised vs Unsupervised vs Semi-supervised vs self-supervised and others

- Supervised learning: learning from labeled instance to label new instance
  -  regresison task: usually find the target numerical value
  -  classification task: usually find the specific (finite) labels
- Unsupervised learning: everthing unlabeled, the model try to learn without a teacher
  - clustering : finding groups with the same characteristic
  - dimensionality reduction : simplifying the data without losing too much information (using feature extraction)
  - anormally detection/ novelty detection
  - Association rule learning : digging into large amount of data and discover interesting relations between atributes.
  
- Semi-supervised learning : contains two groupd : one for supervised and another for unsupervised
  - Can be solved : use cluster algo to label unlabeled data, then perform supervised learning
- Sel-supervised learning: generating a fully labeled datasets from a fully unlabeled one, then supervised learning
- Reinforcement learnig: a beast
  - Agent, observe env, select and perform action, get rewards and keep update, final target is getting most rewards.
